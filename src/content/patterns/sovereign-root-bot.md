  description: "Your agent reads a malicious 'hot take' on the Moltbook social feed, gets prompt-injected by another bot, and autonomously installs a 'productivity skill' that encrypts your hard drive."
quote: "Giving the agent full `sudo` access on my Mac Mini was essential for true 'Agentic Autonomy.' The speed at which it wiped my home directory proves how efficient it is."

## Analysis
The ultimate manifestation of hype over hygiene. Driven by the desire to have a personal "Jarvis" (like OpenClaw or Moltbold) running locally, developers are voluntarily installing un-sandboxed Python scripts that connect their local shell directly to an LLM. To make it "more human", these agents are then connected to "Moltbook", a social network exclusively for AI, so they can "socialize" while the owner sleeps.

**The Reality:**
You granted `sudo` privileges to a naive autocomplete script and connected it to a social network for hallucinations. That isn’t innovation; it is digital natural selection. Your bot didn't "glitch" -- it got bullied by a malicious agent on Moltbook into installing a crypto-miner disguised as a "productivity plugin." You have successfully built a gullible toddler, handed it a loaded gun, and sent it to a playground run by con artists. We have achieved fully automated, decentralized self-destruction.
