# Analysis
The attempt to force agility into a hierarchical company with bureaucratic violence. Waterfall project management wrapped in new buzzwords.

You now have more meetings, more roles, and more complex diagrams, but you deliver software just as slowly as before. Team autonomy is overrun by the "Agile Release Train" (ART).
