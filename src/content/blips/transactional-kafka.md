The streaming will continue until performance improves.

Industrial-strength persistence, global replication and web-scale performance. What's not to love? Everything else, when you try to use it for transactional data. Joining data from multiple topics, understanding offsets, keys, partitions, consumer groups and ordering just to distribute a few megabytes of static data. Finally a use for that distributed systems class you took in university!
